**What are hooks**  
Hooks are a feature introduced in **React 16.8** that allow you to use state and other React features without writing a class. They are functions that let you "hook into" React state and lifecycle features from function components.






***** Custom Hooks *****

Hooks that you create yourself, so other people can use them are called custom hooks.

A custom hook is effectively a function, but with the following properties -

1. Uses another hook internally (useState, useEffect, another custom hook)
2. Starts with use
A few good examples of this can be:

Data fetching hooks
Browser functionality related hooks - useOnlineStatus, useWindowSize, useMousePosition
Performance/Timer based - useInterval, useDebounce
